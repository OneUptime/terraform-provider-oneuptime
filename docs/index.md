# Oneuptime Provider

OpenAPI specification for OneUptime. This document describes the API endpoints, request and response formats, and other details necessary for developers to interact with the OneUptime API.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    oneuptime = {
      source = "oneuptime/oneuptime"
      version = "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "oneuptime" {
  host     = "oneuptime.com"  # Optional, defaults to oneuptime.com (internally becomes oneuptime.com/api)
  api_key  = var.oneuptime_api_key
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `host` (String) The oneuptime host (without /api path). Defaults to 'oneuptime.com' if not specified. The provider automatically appends '/api' to the host. Can also be set via the `ONEUPTIME_HOST` environment variable.
- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) API key for authentication. Can also be set via the `ONEUPTIME_API_KEY` environment variable.
