# oneuptime_v_center (Data Source)

vSphere endpoints (a vCenter Server, or a standalone ESXi host) that are being monitored in this project. Each vCenter is auto-discovered when the OneUptime VMware Agent sends metrics, or can be manually registered. Look up by `id` or by `name` (must match exactly one item).

## Example Usage

Look up by `name` (must match exactly one item) or by `id`:

```terraform
data "oneuptime_v_center" "by_name" {
  name = "example-v_center"
}

data "oneuptime_v_center" "by_id" {
  id = "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
}
```

## Schema

- `id` (String) Look up by unique identifier. Exactly one of `id` or `name` must be set.. Computed.
- `name` (String) Look up by name. Exactly one of `id` or `name` must be set. Fails if the name does not match exactly one item.. Computed.
- `created_at` (String) A date time object.. Computed.
- `updated_at` (String) A date time object.. Computed.
- `deleted_at` (String) A date time object.. Computed.
- `version` (Number) Object version. Computed.
- `project_id` (String) A unique identifier for an object, represented as a UUID.. Computed.
- `slug` (String) Friendly globally unique name for your object.. Computed.
- `description` (String) Friendly description for this vCenter.. Computed.
- `otel_collector_status` (String) Connection status of the OTel Collector agent (connected or disconnected).. Computed.
- `agent_version` (String) Version of the OneUptime VMware Agent reporting telemetry, as self-reported via the oneuptime.agent.version resource attribute.. Computed.
- `last_seen_at` (String) A date time object.. Computed.
- `datacenter_count` (Number) Cached count of vSphere datacenters reported through this vCenter. Written by the ingest snapshot scan; only updated when a batch carries datacenter metrics... Computed.
- `cluster_count` (Number) Cached count of vSphere clusters reported through this vCenter. Written by the ingest snapshot scan; only updated when a batch carries cluster metrics... Computed.
- `host_count` (Number) Cached count of ESXi hosts reported through this vCenter. Written by the ingest snapshot scan; only updated when a batch carries host metrics... Computed.
- `vm_count` (Number) Cached count of virtual machines (excluding VM templates) reported through this vCenter. Written by the ingest snapshot scan; only updated when a batch carries virtual machine metrics... Computed.
- `powered_on_vm_count` (Number) Cached count of virtual machines inferred to be powered on (the vcenter receiver emits CPU metrics only for powered-on VMs). Rendered as 'VMs X/Y powered on' next to vmCount... Computed.
- `datastore_count` (Number) Cached count of datastores reported through this vCenter. Written by the ingest snapshot scan; only updated when a batch carries datastore metrics... Computed.
- `resource_pool_count` (Number) Cached count of resource pools reported through this vCenter. Written by the ingest snapshot scan; only updated when a batch carries resource pool metrics... Computed.
- `datastore_capacity_bytes` (Number) Cached total capacity in bytes summed over every datastore reported through this vCenter (used + available vcenter.datastore.disk.usage). The denominator for the storage-used bar on the overview page. Stored as bigint... Computed.
- `datastore_used_bytes` (Number) Cached used space in bytes summed over every datastore reported through this vCenter (vcenter.datastore.disk.usage{disk_state=used}). Stored as bigint... Computed.
- `created_by_user_id` (String) A unique identifier for an object, represented as a UUID.. Computed.
- `is_archived` (Bool) Is this vCenter archived? Archived vCenters are hidden from lists but keep collecting telemetry... Computed.
- `archived_at` (String) A date time object.. Computed.
- `archived_by_user_id` (String) A unique identifier for an object, represented as a UUID.. Computed.
- `deleted_by_user_id` (String) A unique identifier for an object, represented as a UUID.. Computed.
- `labels` (Set) Relation to Labels Array where this object is categorized in... Computed.
- `retain_telemetry_data_for_days` (Number) Number of days to retain telemetry data for this vCenter. Leave blank to use the project-wide default... Computed.
- `telemetry_retention_config` (String) Per-pillar retention overrides for this vCenter (logs by severity, traces by status, metrics, profiles). Unset fields fall back to the vCenter default, then the project's retention settings... Computed.
- `is_ai_investigation_enabled` (Bool) When on, OneUptime AI runs read-only commands (govc about, ls, vm.info, host.info, events) on this vCenter, through its VMware AI agent, while investigating incidents and alerts linked to it, and uses their output, with secret values redacted, as evidence. Nothing is ever changed by an investigation. On by default. Anyone who may edit the vCenter can turn it on or off... Computed.
- `ai_remediation_mode` (String) Disabled: AI never proposes or runs a change on this vCenter. RequireApproval: AI composes a command plan and a human approves it with one click before anything runs. Automatic: safe changes (SafeWrite) run without a human; a riskier change is proposed for approval unless the vCenter's allowlist names its exact shape. BypassApproval: every change the policy allows — safe AND riskier — runs on its own, except what always needs a human. In EVERY mode: Denied commands never run, commands the policy marks requiresHuman always ask, and the agent itself refuses every write unless it was started with ONEUPTIME_AI_ALLOW_WRITES=true (and then only on the targets ONEUPTIME_AI_WRITE_TARGETS allows, never its protected targets). Anyone who may edit the vCenter can lower the mode; raising it needs Project Owner, Project Admin or Edit Auto Remediation Rule... Computed.
- `ai_command_allowlist` (String) Optional JSON array of command patterns that Automatic mode may run on this vCenter without approval even though they are riskier changes. Each pattern is one command line for this vCenter's agent (govc) and is compared with the command word by word: * stands for exactly one word (a name, an id), never for extra words or flags, and every flag the command uses must be written out in the pattern. At most 50 patterns of at most 500 characters each; a pattern that is not one valid write command for this vCenter is refused. Destructive commands (Denied tier) never run regardless, and a command that always needs a human still asks. Adding a pattern needs Project Owner, Project Admin or Edit Auto Remediation Rule; anyone who may edit the vCenter can remove patterns or clear the list... Computed.
- `ai_access_last_verified_at` (String) A date time object.. Computed.
- `ai_access_last_error` (String) The most recent failure OneUptime AI hit while running a command on this vCenter, kept until the next successful command. Set by the server... Computed.
- `ai_access_configured_at` (String) A date time object.. Computed.
