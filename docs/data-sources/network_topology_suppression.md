# oneuptime_network_topology_suppression (Data Source)

Nodes hidden from the Network Topology map for the whole project. Display only — the device and its monitoring are untouched. Look up by `id` or by `name` (must match exactly one item).

## Example Usage

Look up by `name` (must match exactly one item) or by `id`:

```terraform
data "oneuptime_network_topology_suppression" "by_name" {
  name = "example-network_topology_suppression"
}

data "oneuptime_network_topology_suppression" "by_id" {
  id = "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
}
```

## Schema

- `id` (String) Look up by unique identifier. Exactly one of `id` or `name` must be set.. Computed.
- `name` (String) Look up by name. Exactly one of `id` or `name` must be set. Fails if the name does not match exactly one item.. Computed.
- `created_at` (String) A date time object.. Computed.
- `updated_at` (String) A date time object.. Computed.
- `deleted_at` (String) A date time object.. Computed.
- `version` (Number) Object version. Computed.
- `project_id` (String) A unique identifier for an object, represented as a UUID.. Computed.
- `node_key` (String) The topology node id to hide. A device id for a managed device, 'unmanaged:<name>' for a discovery-protocol peer, or 'endpoint:<id>' for a discovered endpoint. Free text rather than a foreign key because two of the three are synthesised by the topology builder and have no row of their own... Computed.
- `node_name` (String) What the node was called when it was hidden, so the hidden list is readable without rebuilding the graph... Computed.
- `reason` (String) Why this node was hidden — the note the next person needs to decide whether it should stay hidden... Computed.
- `created_by_user_id` (String) A unique identifier for an object, represented as a UUID.. Computed.
- `deleted_by_user_id` (String) A unique identifier for an object, represented as a UUID.. Computed.
